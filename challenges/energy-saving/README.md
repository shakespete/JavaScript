## Welcome!

This exercise is divided into three parts - we expect that you'd be able to get through Part 1,
and then either Part 2 or Part 3, or both. Note that you don't strictly need to do part 2 or 3 in order,
but they do build on the exercise in Part 1.

We're not interested in esoteric JavaScript or development tool knowledge, but rather to see how you
structure your code. Things like:
- Understandability and maintainability
- Good programming habits
- Code style
- Attention to detail


You are welcome to draw on any other resources you may need to get started with Node.js,
format your code or to check syntax.(The exercise is meant to be realistic in that you can
use documentation and tools as needed to complete your work to a professional standard).


## Getting Started
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies e.g.:
```sh
cd questions
npm install
```
3. Run the tests with `npm test` to validate your working. **The goal is to get
all the tests passing.**

You shouldn't not need to modify the tests, but feel free to add new tests to help you complete the
challenge or improve the validation - we might have missed a scenario!

You can also run the tests in 'watch' (continuous update mode) with:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```

## Submitting the challenge
1. Ensure you've formatted your code using `npm run format` before submission.
2. Raise a PR in this repository with your solution.
3. Send us an email, and we'll set up a time and go through your answers, either over a video-call or in-person.
